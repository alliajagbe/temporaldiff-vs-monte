# Temporal Difference
### Showed a small simulation showing the difference between temporal difference and monte carlo. 
### Also showed a simulation showing a simulation for qlearning - an off policy TD control method. 
### The sarsa.py file shows how the qtable is generated with the formula provided in the Reinforcement Learning textbook by Sutton.
